# Apollo Case Study for Frontend

## Introduction:
This is a React + TypeScript project, bootstrap with Vite. I did not go with Next.js as there aren't many features of Next that can be utilized in this particular use case.

## Running the app:
There aren't any configurations that need to be made or any sensitive environment variables. Therefore running the app is straightforward:

- Clone the repository by
```git clone https://github.com/mtajammulzia/apollo-case-study.git```

- Go to the project directory
```cd apollo-case-study```

- Install project dependencies
```yarn```
or
```yarn install```

- Run the development server
```yarn dev```

- Build and run via bundle
```yarn build```

## Running tests:
I have added sample tests for Dashboard and Signin page, other pages follow similar pattern.

- Running tests
```yarn test```
